Pseudo Code for Binary Search of Numbers


1. Guess the number that is halfway between the highest possible number and the lowest possible number. (The first guess will always be 50) The other player will respond with “too high,” “too low,” or “correct.”

2. If the other player responds with “too high,” reassign your guess as the new highest possible number. If they respond with “too low,” reassign your guess as the new lowest possible number.

3. If the number that you are going to guess is a decimal, round it down to the nearest whole number.

4. Repeat steps one and two until the other player responds with “correct.”
